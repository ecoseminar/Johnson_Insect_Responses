# Johnson_Insect_Responses

This shiny app illustrates how seasonal temperature variation and climate change can affect insect population dynamics.
The user can vary the current climate, climate change, initial insect densities, and some plot options and the shiny app
will plot the temperature responses of reproduction, development, and mortality and then forecasts the population dynamics
of a hypothetical insect species.
